# AudioVisualizer

# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

JP's Audio Visualizer

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Audio visualizer in max msp that generates visuals and reacts to the music based off frequencies that are divided in groups like drum tracks, bass, and melody

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will interpret frequencies from an audio file and seperate them based off drums, bass, and melody. Fromn there, each of these different groups will affect a randomly generated image. AS the music plays, the image (most liekly 3d objects) will react to the music.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

NA

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

NA

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I hope to learn how to make basic audio visualizers in Max at the bear minumum. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Idealy, I would like to understand how to generate the graphics into something very beautiful.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome is to get a general understand of Max where I can freely apply it again. Additionaly, I would like my project outcome to be something I can use more than once.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps are researching Max, reaching out to propular creators for advice, and play around with more basic versions of my project. There are alot of artists that I see online that do this same thing to a grand exent. I would like to reach out to them for their advice.
